# frontend_with_less_css

This is a simple front-end project using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS and Less CSS.

Less is a dynamic preprocessor style sheet language that can be compiled into CSS. 

Some basic guidelines:
-create a file with a name: app.less
-place your less css codes in app.less file.
-to automatically create a css file, run the app using this format: lessc <name of the less file> <space> <name of the css file>
-in this case it's: lessc app.less app.css
